2. Spoon hummus onto a plate, creating a bit of a well in the center.  Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with fresh chopped parsley.  Serve with your favorite flat bread, crackers, chips, or fresh vegetables.

Recipe Notes: Ingredient amounts, including garlic can be adjusted to suit your own taste.  Be careful with the hot sauce, a little bit adds a nice boost, but too much will overpower the flavors of the hummus.  If you cook your own garbanzo beans rather than using canned, reserve a bit of the cooking liquid to thin the hummus in place of plain water.",You also might have noticed that I took a week off from The BBA Challenge.

Not Your Mother’s Casseroles was written by Faith Durand, managing editor of Apartment Therapy’s The Kitchn, so it should come as no surprise that the book is fantastic.  There are a few classic recipes like Basic Potluck Baked Beans with Bacon and then there are fun new twists on classics, such as Mediterranean Tuna Casserole with Olives and Capers and Twice-Baked Potatoes Stuffed with Ricotta and Ground Sausage.",6,link,http://pinchmysalt.com/artichoke-hummus/,en,http://pinchmysalt.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_2692.jpg

2. Spoon hummus onto a plate, creating a bit of a well in the center.  Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with fresh chopped parsley.  Serve with your favorite flat bread, crackers, chips, or fresh vegetables.

Recipe Notes: Ingredient amounts, including garlic can be adjusted to suit your own taste.  Be careful with the hot sauce, a little bit adds a nice boost, but too much will overpower the flavors of the hummus.  If you cook your own garbanzo beans rather than using canned, reserve a bit of the cooking liquid to thin the hummus in place of plain water.",You also might have noticed that I took a week off from The BBA Challenge.

</ul>",,"Most baked dips, while usually delicious, aren’t exactly healthy.  I love a nice creamy baked artichoke dip or a warm pinto bean dip covered with melted cheese, but they aren’t something I feel like I can indulge in all the time.

That’s why I’m so happy I discovered this Baked White Bean Dip with Rosemary and Parmesan from Faith Durand’s new cookbook, Not Your Mother’s Casseroles.  It satisfies my craving for a decadent warm dip, but is healthy enough to enjoy whenever I want.  The dip is a snap to make and uses pantry staples like canned beans, olive oil, and bread crumbs so it’s easy to throw together for unexpected guests or impromptu gatherings.","I’m pretty picky when it comes to accepting review copies of cookbooks because I just don’t have room for more books.  But I love casseroles, and I really liked the idea of a casserole book with 200 recipes, not one of which calls for a can of condensed soup.

Not Your Mother’s Casseroles was written by Faith Durand, managing editor of Apartment Therapy’s The Kitchn, so it should come as no surprise that the book is fantastic.
